Use the solution to this afternoon's Property Tracker lab to answer the following questions. Please write your answers under each question, push the file to GitHub, and submit in the usual way.

## MVP Questions

In our Property Tracker application:

Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the `Property` class?

- In console.rb file

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby `Property` object into the database?

- In the SQL file created in the DB folder

Q3. In `console.rb`, which lines modify the database?



Q4. Why do we not define the id of a `Property` object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?

- As each ID is unique to the instance and 

Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby `Property` object?

- Initialize method

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an `if` clause) on the `@id` attribute in the constructor?

- To check if the id exists and is there

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?

- Some methods have to be called on instances such as update - as updating a specific instance. However other methods are called on the whole class such as delete all.

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to `db.exec_prepared()`? In the `save` method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?

- 

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?

- We used prepared statements as certain constant values are substituted during each execution so makes it more simple

## Extension Questions

Look at the `find_by_id` and `find_by_address` methods in the `Property` class.

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?

- The first takes in the ID as the argument and the second takes in the address as the argument.

Q11. What are their return values?
